# RentCafe
Rent Cafe is website that provides a common platform for tenants and landlords to locate
properties of interest in India and source information about all property related issues. Rent
cafe focusses on building an ecosystem to mitigate challenges faced by bachelors while
relocating to a new place. Rent Cafe vision is to make the whole relocation process less
complicated for everyone. The idea of relocating to a new place is always exciting but as we
know it can be a bit challenging as well as it costs huge efforts & a lot of time to find the
perfect place.
This process can be really challenging due to various reasons such as unfamiliarity about the
state/city, grocery, high brokerage charges and many more. Even if you find your perfect place
you don’t know anything about your flat mate at first. This motivated to move ahead with rent
café.
Rent café will find you a roommate according to your preference. The main objective behind
Rent Cafe is to help bachelors find properties according to their preference, find a roommate
who has matching lifestyle, it also helps the landlord to find tenants according to his
preference.
